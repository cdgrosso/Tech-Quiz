# Tech Quiz App â€“ Cypress Testing Suite

This project is a full-stack **Tech Quiz Application** built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The app presents users with a set of ten random tech questions, tracks their answers, displays the final score, and allows them to retake the quiz.

This enhanced version integrates **Cypress** for both **component** and **end-to-end testing** to ensure the quiz functionality behaves as expected.
